# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App].

## Available Scripts

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view the app in the browser.
Open [http://localhost:8081](http://localhost:8081) to view the server in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm run test`

Launches the story test runner in the interactive watch mode besides the server too.
